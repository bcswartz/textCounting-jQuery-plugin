The textCounting jQuery plugin makes it easy to add a character or word counter to your HTML textarea elements so you can indicate to the user how many more characters or words they can type in.

To read about how the plugin works, either consult the plugin homepage (http://www.thoughtdelimited.org/thoughts/demos/textCounting/) or view the documentation contained within the "documented" version of the plugin file.
